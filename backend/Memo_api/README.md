## Overview

The **Loan Underwriting Memo API** automates the generation of structured credit underwriting memos for loan applications. It merges applicant profile data with credit bureau data, computes a deterministic risk score, and uses Groq-hosted LLaMA 3.1 to generate three professional underwriting reasons — all returned as a structured JSON memo in under one second.

Built for Indian fintech and NBFC workflows where speed, consistency, and explainable credit decisions are critical.

## Where This Fits in the Larger System

This service is a **standalone backend microservice** within a broader credit lending platform. It exposes a single REST endpoint consumed by:

* **Frontend dashboards** — credit officers reviewing loan applications
* **CreditSentinel** — external credit scoring API (integrated, non-fatal fallback)
* **Orchestration layer** — upstream services that pass `application\_id` and consume the memo JSON

## Features

* ⚡ **Sub-second memo generation** — powered by Groq's `llama-3.1-8b-instant`
* 🧮 **Deterministic risk scoring** — weighted CIBIL + FOIR formula, no randomness in decisions
* 📋 **Structured 6-section output** — profile, risk assessment, credit history, repayment capacity, risk factors, recommendation
* 🔗 **Graceful external API integration** — CreditSentinel fallback, never crashes memo generation
* 🛡️ **CORS-enabled** — ready for any frontend or cross-origin integration
* 🔐 **Secure by default** — API key loaded from environment, never hardcoded
* 🗂️ **15,000+ loan records** — pre-loaded datasets across diverse Indian applicant profiles

\---

### `bureau\_data.csv`

Credit bureau records per applicant — joined on `application\_id`.

|Column|Description|
|-|-|
|`application\_id`|Matches loan application record|
|`cibil\_score`|CIBIL credit score (300–900)|
|`num\_active\_loans`|Active loans reported at bureau level|

## How It Works

```
POST /api/memo  →  { "application\_id": "APP-000001" }
        │
        ▼
   Merge loan\_applications + bureau\_data on application\_id
        │
        ▼
   Compute Risk Score  →  (CIBIL × 0.55 + FOIR × 0.45) × 0.72
        │
        ▼
   Classify Risk Level  →  LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
        │
        ▼
   Build prompt  →  Call Groq LLaMA 3.1  →  Parse 3 underwriting reasons
        │
        ▼
   (Optional) Call CreditSentinel API  →  non-fatal fallback on failure
        │
        ▼
   Return structured 6-section memo JSON + decision
```

\---

## Risk Scoring Logic

```python
cibil\_component = (cibil\_score - 300) / 600      # Normalised 0–1
foir\_component  = (100 - foir) / 100              # Normalised 0–1

risk\_score = (cibil\_component \* 0.55 + foir\_component \* 0.45) \* 0.72
```

|Risk Score|Risk Level|Decision|
|-|-|-|
|≥ 0.70|🟢 LOW|APPROVE|
|0.50 – 0.69|🟡 MEDIUM|APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS|
|< 0.50|🔴 HIGH|REJECT|
